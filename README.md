6. Take a reasonable sized screenshot of your profile README.
7. Go to remote GitHub, and upload the image anywhere, making sure you get a url - example: `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70807500/172058698-c25e73c5-8c4e-4949-bf57-6a59965bde0a.png`.

2. Clone it locally.
3. Go to the README.md where all the votes and profiles are.

## 🎯 How does the League grouping work and how will the winner be determined?

- Once all leagues are full, the 48 hour countdown will begin. This means there will be 48 hours for people to vote.
- After the time period, App-Choreographers will come and re-order the profiles depending on the amount of votes given.
- This will be repeated 5 times. After 10 days, there will be a clear winner!
- First come, first serve! Those who contribute first and add their profiles will be added in ascending order, meaning that the first contributor will be the frst name in League 1, and the last contributor will be the last name in League 3.

## The Winner 🏆:
Once the winner is determined this is what they get:

- A professional and personalised digital banner, which you can customize once you win showing you have the best GitHub profile README.
- Their name and GitHub link will be added to App-Choreo's website.
- The owner of this organisation CodingSpecies, will add the link of the winners profile to their own profile README.
- Other prizes are still to be considered.


## 🎯 Filling in the Leagues:

- To add your entry, replace the `NAME 1` (or whatever number) with your GitHub name and link in this format: `[GitHub Name](githubprofilelink)`.
- Where it says `Profile Screenshot 1`(or whatever number) change it to your profile README screenshot.
